Oh, you found my keys! I was looking for those!

Here are my [_SSH_](./ssh) and my [_PGP_](./pgp) pubkeys in a nice, `curl`able format.

Handy!

```
# To add my PGP key to your keyring, run:
curl https://caseyspar.kz/keys/pgp | gpg --import

# To give me SSH access to your host (don't do this) run:
curl https://caseyspar.kz/keys/ssh >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
