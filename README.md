# caseysparkz/infrastructure
This repository is a monorepo for all infrastructure in both my personal homelab, and personal domain.


## Filesystem Heirarchy
* Each domain contains its own directory in the top-level repository.
* Each component (Docker images, k8s configurations, Ansible playbooks, Terraform configurations) has its own
    subdirectory under its relevant domain.


## Secrets Management
* Terraform-specific secrets (such as AWS/Cloudflare API keys) should exist in the user's shell as
    `$TF_VAR_variable_name` variables.
* All other secrets should exist in AWS Secrets Manager and be called by code.
