## A Jamstack static frontend, Lambda backend, Terraformed infrastructure, and Github Actions CI/CD
[View on Github](https://github.com/caseysparkz/infrastructure)


This website is written in Tailwind CSS and Javascript, built with Hugo, and Terraformed and deployed via Github
Actions. Its backend (currently only the _<a href="../contact">contact page</a>_) runs on AWS Lambda.

Its codebase (and the codebase for all infrustructure under my domain) is viewable
_[here](https://github.com/caseysparkz/infrastructure/tree/main/caseyspar.kz/terraform/www)_ and relevant
configurations are hyperlinked whenever mentioned.


## <u>Terraform</u>
I've been working with Terraform since 2020, when I first made the switch from system administration to
development operations.

This website (and my domain as a whole) can solely be deployed with a `terraform apply` from the Terraform root
_[`caseyspar.kz/terraform`](https://github.com/caseysparkz/infrastructure/tree/main/caseyspar.kz/terraform)_;
this stands up all DNS for the root domain, and all infrastructure for subdomains.


### *Root Domain*
The root domain is controlled by
_[`caseyspar.kz/terraform/main.tf`](https://github.com/caseysparkz/infrastructure/blob/main/caseyspar.kz/terraform/main.tf)_ 
and its supplementary Terraform configs. At a minimum, it contains the root _[DNS
records](https://github.com/caseysparkz/infrastructure/blob/main/caseyspar.kz/terraform/main.tf)_.

Subdomains are configured as modules, and can be added or removed from the domain root with the inclusion or
exclusion of a module block in
_[`caseyspar.kz/terraform/main.tf`](https://github.com/caseysparkz/infrastructure/blob/main/caseyspar.kz/terraform/main.tf)_.


### *Subdomains*
Subdomains for the site are included in the Terraform config as modules, allowing any given subdomain (eg:
_[www.caseyspar.kz](www.caseyspar.kz)_) to be added or removed by editing
_[`main.tf`](https://github.com/caseysparkz/infrastructure/blob/main/caseyspar.kz/terraform/main.tf)_ to include
its corresponding module and outputs.


## <u>Hugo</u>
As someone with little to no proficiency in HTML, Javascript, or CSS, _[Hugo](https://gohugo.io)_ is a huge help in
standing up frontends, and requires relatively little coding to plug in a
_[Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/lambda/)_ backend.

Having a static frontend with a Lambda backend provides advantages to both the cost and security of the site, with
the added benefit of being able to write your backend in Java, Go, PowerShell, Node.js, C#, Python, or Ruby.

The
_[infrastructure](https://github.com/caseysparkz/infrastructure/tree/main/caseyspar.kz/terraform/infrastructure)_
module creates an `s3://artifacts` bucket in which Lambda functions can be stored.


## <u>Lamba</u>


## <u>CI/CD</u>
### *Github Actions*

## <u>Deployment</u>
If you choose to replicate this deployment, **the order in which you deploy resources matters!**

1. Run `terraform apply` from `caseyspar.kz/terraform/infrastructure/tf_backend_s3`. This creates the S3 backend
for Terraform's state file.
2. Comment out all modules in `caseyspar.kz/terraform/main.tf` **except** `infrastructure` and run `terraform
apply. This creates your root DNS and backend resources such as the `artifacts` S3 bucket.
3. Uncomment the remaining modules in `caseyspar.kz/terraform/main.tf` (as needed/desired), and run `terraform
apply` once again.
