# GitHub Actions

This directory contains CI/CD configurations via
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

For more information, refer to the [GitOps](https://taumotors.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DEVOPS/pages/82935809/GitOps)
and [GitHub Actions](https://taumotors.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DEVOPS/pages/95551490/Github+Actions)
pages in the [DevOps Confluence
space](https://taumotors.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DEVOPS/overview).

Tau uses GitHub Actions to automate the testing and deployment of new software.

Some of these tests are standard across all repositories (such as those
enforcing a specific style of commit message), while others (such as linters,
and CI actions) will be specific to a repository or language.

GitHub workflows are written in YAML, and are consumed and run on a
pre-specified event (such as a push, or a pull request).

**NB:** GitHub does not implement all standard YAML structures. Tags and anchors
are noticeably missing, and should not appear in any YAML files, that get
consumed by GitHub, such as `dependabot.yml`.

## Recommended Software

* [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/)
* [nektos/act](https://nektosact.com/): Run GitHub Actions locally.
* [yamllint](https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint): Validate YAML files.

## Best Practices

Using actions from the GitHub marketplace can be less secure than than using
GitHubâ€™s prebuilt actions (or writing your own, though there are steps one can
take to mitigate these risks.

### Documentation

In-line Github Action documentation should be fairly minimal, as each step with
a `uses` statement inherently points to its own documentation via the author,
repo, and commit or tag (ie: `uses: '{AUTHOR}/{REPO}@{COMMIT_OR_TAG}'`).

To find the README for a step, convert the used image into one of the following
URL formats (depending on whether you have used a commit or a tag:

1. `https://github.com/{AUTHOR}/{REPO}/commit/{COMMIT}` or
1. `https://github.com/{AUTHOR}/{REPO}/releases/tag/{TAG}`

### Config Files

If your action consumes a configuration file, then place that file
in the [.github/config](../config/README.md) directory. This avoids YAML config
files accidentally being consumed by GitHub Actions.

### Code Review

_Every marketplace GitHub Action is open source._ Make a good-faith effort to
review third-party actions before using them.

Consider:

* **Number of contributors.** Third-party actions with many contributors will
   have been reviewed by several peers, as opposed to one potential bad actor.
* **Popularity.** How many times has the action been starred?
* **How recently the action was updated.** Is it well-maintained?
* **Code review.** Perform your own review of the Action code.

### Hash-locking

While version-locking can be tempting, versions can be over-written. Instead,
lock your actions to the commit hash of a specific version, rather than a tag or
release. Commit hashes are a SHA1 sum derived from the commit, commit tree, and
changed files. Commit hashes cannot (easily) be collided or modified with
malicious intent.

Versions that correspond to a given hash should appear both:

* As a comment in the action's YAML file.
* In the [version.manifest](./version.manifest) file.

**NB:** When hash-locking Actions requirements, GitHub requires the full hash
of the release version (eg: `fdef6bc189425ecc84cc4543b2674566c0827053`
not `fdef6bc`).

**NB:** Remember to update [version.manifest](./version.manifest) (in YAML
format) with each **new** dependent action used by this repository.

_Bad code:_

```yaml
[...]
      - name: 'Yamllint'
        uses: 'karancode/yamllint-github-action@2.1.1'
...
```

_Worse code:_

```yaml
[...]
      - name: 'Yamllint'
        uses: 'karancode/yamllint-github-action@fdef6bc'  # v2.1.1
...
```

_Good code:_

```yaml
[...]
      - name: 'Yamllint'
        uses: 'karancode/yamllint-github-action@fdef6bc189425ecc84cc4543b2674566c0827053'
...
```
